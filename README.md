## Summary

Create 'Synth Pad' - a playable grid-based musical instrument where each pad plays a note and lights up.

ðŸŽ¹ CONCEPT:
A 4x4 or 5x5 grid of colorful pads. Click a pad â†’ it plays a musical note, glows, and animates. It's like a launchpad or drum machine you can actually play melodies on.

âœ¨ THE GRID:
- 16-25 large, tactile pads arranged in a grid
- Each pad is a different vibrant color (neon aesthetic)
- Each pad plays a different note (chromatic or pentatonic scale)
- Pads glow bright when pressed
- Ripple/pulse animation on click
- Shows note name when hovered (C4, D4, E4, etc.)

ðŸŽµ SOUND:
- Use Web Audio API
- Clean synth sounds (sine, square, or sawtooth waves)
- Each pad = different pitch
- Notes sustain briefly then fade
- Can play multiple pads simultaneously (chords!)
- Optional: add reverb/echo effect

ðŸŽ® INTERACTION:
- Click pad: plays note + animation
- Keyboard support: QWERTY keys mapped to pads (Q=top-left, etc.)
- Can 'play' melodies by clicking in sequence
- Shows visual feedback: which pad was last pressed
- Optional: record and playback feature

ðŸŽ¨ VISUAL STYLE:
- Dark background (black or deep purple)
- Neon-colored pads with gradients
- Glow effects when active
- Modern, musical instrument aesthetic
- Smooth animations
- Large, touch-friendly pads

ðŸ’« FEATURES:
- Top controls: 
  * Octave shift buttons (up/down)
  * Volume slider
  * Waveform selector (sine/square/saw)
- Shows currently playing notes
- Optional: metronome visual
- Optional: display played sequence

ðŸŽ¯ THE EXPERIENCE:
Someone clicks a pad â†’ 'beep' + glow. Clicks another â†’ different note. They realize they can play tunes. Start clicking out melodies. Discover keyboard shortcuts. Play chords. Show friends. Actually musical and fun!

It's not just eye candy - it's a playable instrument!
